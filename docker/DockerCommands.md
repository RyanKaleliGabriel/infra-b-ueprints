## A Section i'll be documenting docker commands


## Image Building

 - Building an image. The image name must be in lowercase. Navigate inside the directory where you have the docker file and run

   ```
   docker build -t image_name:tag .
   ```

## Container Operations

 - Checking all containers

   ```
   docker ps -a
   ```
